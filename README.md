<strong>This is my online store project. I made it for my friend who has his own online store on Instagram. Very simple pages, but multifunctional:</strong>
- Several pages are written in <strong>Asynchronous Programming</strong>
- Support page for contacting the user
- Shopping cart
- Order placement via <strong>Nova Posta delivery service</strong> in a specific branch or via <strong>Worldwide order</strong> and final payment via <strong>PayPal</strong>
- Custom <strong>Admin Panel</strong>
- <strong>API</strong> implementation
- <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> connected
- Some functions written in <strong>JavaScript</strong> to make the frontend more convenient
- Sending messages via <strong>Celery</strong> and using <strong>Redis as a broker</strong>
- Still configured <strong>CeleryBeat</strong> to monitor site performance
- Running the site with <strong>WSGI</strong>
- Also using and connected <strong>NGINX</strong> web server
- <strong>Adaptive design</strong> for all devices
- Project has been successfully deployed and launched on the <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> platform
